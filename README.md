You've been given the assignment to make a form template library for reuse in php 7+ using OOP.
This will be used to design a website that other developers will add to.
For now you're tasked with running sample.php that generates a web view similar to the screenshot.png.

Given Form.php, Input.php, Sample.php create a TextInput.php class in addition to filling out the stubbed methods for the library.


#################### Running the project ####################

This project requires docker.

I`ve created a shell file to make it easy for anyone to run the project, you just need to run the "run_project" shell file
and a php container will be created inside your docker running the project on the http://localhost:8080/ url. Pretty simple.
